            This system helps in reducing the efforts and time taken for parking. Our project involves the using of ardunio, which makes more efficient response.
            Generally, as increasing in population increasing the usage of Vehicles. The main problem is that if we enter into malls or any parking area, we clearly have no idea whether
            parking slots are available or not unless we go and search for it. This takes time ,fuel consumption and unwanted disturbance to others too. This can be solved by using our project.
            It involves as everytime a car or vehicle enters into the parking slot, it gets counted using the sensors placed at the entrance of the gates. There will also be a 
            display unit where it displays the available slots. Same as if vehicle goes out of the parking, the availability of parking slots count increases. This helps users to know
            about the availability of parking slots even before entering into it.
